"""Group cards into banks by their MEASURED tail, from logs already on disk (hazync#550).

⭐ WHY. The fold waits for the slowest peer at every level, so one bad link sets the wall clock for
the whole block — and **adding cards does not fix a tail, it adds levels for the tail to appear at.**
Measured on tip hour 4 (13,676 labelled joins, 37 cards): per-card join p90 ranged 3,562 ms to
45,253 ms, a **12.7x spread on a UNIFORM fleet** of 38 identical cards at one price. So the spread is
not the card model, and `--gpu-type` cannot address it.

⛔ THAT WAS PUBLISHED AS 5.6x AND 5.6x WAS HALF A HARVEST — `agg-history.log` alone, 9,366 of 13,676
joins, missing the live `agg.log` that holds the run's worst tail. **Pass every aggregate log.**

Today that measurement is used only to CUT (`--worker-min-mbit`, `slow_worker_cut`, which defaults
to 0.0 and did not fire in hour 4). #550 proposes using it to GROUP: cards that feed each other
quickly form a bank, and each bank takes its own block. A bank's wall is set by its slowest member,
so segregating the tail into one bank leaves the other bank with a far better worst peer.

⛔⛔ BUT A RATIO OF WORST PEERS OVERSTATES THE PRIZE. "5.1x better worst peer" is what this tool
reported for hour 4, and it invites the reading that a bank would prove 5x faster. What the fold
actually waits for is the slowest join in each batch that is in flight together, and that is
measurable from the same logs: summed over hour 4's 619 batches it is 6,416 s, and removing the
worst card entirely takes off **12.9 %**; the worst five, 27.8 %.

⛔ AND THE PRIZE DEPENDS ON THE FLEET SIZE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF #550. Replicated on tip
hour 5 (2026-09-30, 6 rankable cards, 258 batches, the SAME tool and the same two logs):

    fleet    drop the worst card
    37          12.9 %
     6          45.2 %

One bad card in six is in nearly every batch and sets the wall nearly every time; one in
thirty-seven is not. ⇒ **A bank suffers its worst member far more than the whole fleet does**,
which argues for banking and warns that the slow bank pays for it.

⚠ AND THE CURVE DOES NOT "SATURATE" -- I published that, and it was the shape of the window I
chose. The default `ks` stops at ten, and inside that window hour 4 does flatten (27.8 % at five,
30.2 % at ten). Over the full range it climbs again: 49.5 % at twenty-two, 74.9 % at thirty-one.
Of course it does -- past a point it is measuring a tiny fleet, not a tail. So `tail_prize` now
reports how many cards are LEFT at each step and refuses a step that leaves fewer than MIN_FLEET.

⛔ AND THE DATACENTRE LABEL IS NOT THE SIGNAL — REPLICATED ON TWO RUNS. Decomposing the variance
of log(rtt):

                        hour 4            hour 5
                   (37 cards, 9 dc)   (6 cards, 2 dc)
    WHEN (batch)        31.4 %            26.1 %
    WHICH LEVEL         21.6 %            28.6 %
    WHICH CARD          17.3 %            17.5 %      <- near identical across both
    WHICH DATACENTRE    12.7 %             7.8 %      <- smallest in both

⭐ The CARD share lands within 0.2 points on two runs whose fleets differ sixfold, which is the
strongest thing measured here. And `dc` is the smallest term in both, so grouping by it would
capture almost none of the spread. #550's own wording -- bank by measured link, not by a datacentre
label -- is what the data supports.

⚠ Hour 5's dc row rests on TWO groups covering four of its six cards, so on its own it is weak; it
does not contradict hour 4 and is not independent confirmation either. Cited as replication of the
ORDERING, not of the number.

⚠ AND THE CARD EFFECT IS SMALLER AND LESS STABLE THAN THE SPREAD SUGGESTS. Measured against the
cards it joined alongside, rather than against the whole run, the per-card effect is 6.5x
(0.46x .. 2.98x) — and a card's p90 in the first half of the run predicts its second half with
Spearman rho +0.44. A slow card tends to stay slow; it is not a fixed property, so a bank assignment
made once at the start of a run decays.

⛔ WHAT THIS TOOL DOES NOT DO — AND WHY IT STOPS SHORT ON PURPOSE.

  * It does not predict a block time. It reports each bank's WORST PEER and, given cohorts, the
    measured share of the fold's waiting that the tail accounts for. Turning either into a block
    time needs a model of the join tree under a different fleet size, and this project has a scar
    from exactly that: lever 2 was predicted to save ~36 s from a plausible model and measured
    NEGATIVE.
  * `tail_prize` is an UPPER BOUND, not a saving. The dropped cards' segments still have to be
    proved by someone, and a second bank pays its own fold. It bounds the prize.
  * It does not turn anything on. Two banks need TWO AGGREGATES and two concurrent blocks — the
    aggregate executes a specific block and cannot be shared (#506). That orchestration is not
    built. This answers "is it worth building?", not "switch it on".

⚠ A card is ranked only if it has enough joins to have a meaningful p90. A card with 12 samples
sitting beside one with 335 is not a comparison, and the early blocks of a run — 3 to 10 cards
attached — carry RTTs inflated by QUEUEING rather than transport (`[rtt]` is dispatch-to-return).
Under-sampled cards are named and excluded, never quietly merged.
