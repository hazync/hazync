"""Verify a host binary carries the canonical guest — from the FILE, with no GPU (hazync#631).

⛔⛔ WHY RUNNING THE BINARY CANNOT BE THE CHECK ON A CI RUNNER.

`host.exe method-id` was the gate on the most important property in this project: that a proof from
this binary is worth anything. On a windows runner it exited **127** three times. 127 is "command
not found", and the exe was demonstrably there — the same run uploaded it, 251,232,768 bytes.

I guessed a missing `cudart64_12.dll` and shipped it. It exited 127 again, with cudart sitting
beside it. ⇒ So I read the import table instead of guessing a third time, and it says:

    nvcuda.dll        ← the CUDA DRIVER API

`nvcuda.dll` ships with the NVIDIA **driver**, not with the CUDA redist. A GPU-less runner has no
driver, so Windows cannot load the image, and NOTHING copied next to the exe will change that.
⚠ `cudart64_12.dll` is not even in the import table — the cudart theory was wrong twice over.

⇒ Running a CUDA-linked host is not a check CI can perform. It is a check the OWNER of a GPU
machine can perform in one line, and that is where it belongs.

⭐ WHAT *CAN* BE CHECKED HERE, AND IT IS NOT A WEAKER CLAIM BY MUCH. The guest is embedded in the
binary verbatim. Measured on the 177 MB artifact of run 37155135563:

    'R0BF' at offset 12,281,328 — 69,980,208 bytes — sha256 35e3f55e…  == reproduce/GUEST_ELF_SHA256

⚠ THE GUEST IS NOT AN ELF, despite the `HAZYNC_GUEST_ELF` variable that names it. It is risc0's
R0BF container and begins "R0BF". Searching for `\\x7fELF` finds 51 coincidental hits in this binary
and none of them is the guest — which is exactly the wrong turn this script exists to prevent.

⇒ So: find the embedded guest, hash it, compare with the pin. That proves the binary carries the
canonical guest. It does NOT recompute the image id — `reproduce/GUEST_ELF_SHA256` explains at
length why no MSVC-linked build can (risc0-zkvm-platform's `sys_alloc_aligned` is an unresolved
external under link.exe), and why this second pin exists for precisely this reason.

⛔ SAY WHICH OF THE TWO WAS ESTABLISHED. "The binary is canonical" was once printed by a step that
had only checked that a FILE EXISTED, in a run where the id check had just failed. Never again:
this reports the guest as verified and the image id as NOT read, separately.
