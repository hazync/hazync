# ⚠ This said `hazync-coord` until 2026-09-18. That alias points at 152.53.93.164, the ORIGINAL
# coordinator, which was retired that day. The coordinator has been 159.195.207.224 (`hazync-proof`)
# since the 2026-09-16 cutover, so anyone following the old usage line checked a box that is gone.
#
# WHY THIS DIRECTION. The obvious check is "every path a doc names must exist". That check would
# NOT have caught the incident this script exists for. On 2026-08-25 the production coordinator's
# base unit turned out to be a hand-edited hybrid: dead pre-#58 /root paths sitting alongside two
# settings that were live, load-bearing, and present nowhere in this repo --
#
#     COORD_BIND=0.0.0.0        TRUSTED_PROXIES=83.136.255.218
#
# Replacing that base with the repo copy silently dropped both. COORD_BIND fell back to 127.0.0.1,
# which would have stopped the coordinator accepting the nginx proxy from the web box. Every path
# in the repo's unit existed; the danger ran the other way. So the useful question is not "does
# what we wrote down exist" but "is anything running that we never wrote down".
#
# systemd makes the failure silent twice over: `systemctl cat` prints superseded lines as if they
# were live, and `daemon-reload` does not restart, so a bad edit detonates at some arbitrary later
# restart with nothing wrong in any log.
